## What is the Cheapest Minecraft Server Hosting in Australia?

To determine the absolute cheapest options, we need to look at the lowest starting prices across all providers, keeping in mind that these entry-level plans will have limitations in terms of RAM, player slots, and performance.  Here's a recap of the cheapest plans from each provider:

1.  **Sparked Hosting:**  The Asteroid plan, at $2.53 AUD per *quarter* (which is less than $1 AUD per month), is the absolute cheapest option. However, with only 512MB of RAM, it's extremely limited and only suitable for the smallest, most basic vanilla servers.

2.  **Apex Hosting:** Their Proxy (512MB) plan is the next cheapest, with prices around $4.02/Month, used for connecting servers.

3.  **Shockbyte:** The "Dirt" plan starts at $6.42 AUD per month, offering 1GB of RAM. This is a more practical starting point for a small vanilla server or a server with very few plugins.

4.  **Stipe.com.au:**  Stipe's 1GB Budget plan starts at $6.50 AUD per month, very close to Shockbyte's pricing.

5.  **MCHostingPro:** While MCHostingPro offers a free 10-day trial ("Freeman" plan), their cheapest paid plan is the "Iron" plan at $13.50 AUD per month (before any discounts). The free trial is a great way to test their services, but it's not a long-term solution.
